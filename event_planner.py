# 2. Quick Decisions: The Event Planner ðŸŽ‰
# Objective:

# To practice the use of shorthand if statements in determining event-related decisions.

# Task 1: Code Correction

# You are provided with a Python script that is supposed to help in event planning, but it has errors. Identify and fix them.

# Buggy Code:

# attendees = input("Enter number of attendees: ")
# venue = "large hall" if attendees > 100 else "conference room"
# print(venue)
# Task 2: Venue Selection

# Based on the corrected code from Task 1, further enhance the program to recommend additional facilities like "audio system" or "projector" 
# based on the number of attendees.

# Task 3: Catering Choices

# Ask the user if they want "vegetarian" food. Recommend "Veggie Delight Caterers" if yes, otherwise recommend "Gourmet Meals Caterers".
